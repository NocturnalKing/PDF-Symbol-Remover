# PDF-Symbol-Remover

This is a symbol remover program that takes in 2 inputs: the symbol to be removed, and the phrase or passage you want to remove it from. I made this program to solve a specific problem I had at the time which was that a pdf I needed information from inserted the $ character in place of spaces when I copied it. This was originally made on repl.it in 2021.
